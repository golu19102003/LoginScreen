## Android Login Form App (Java) 
**Overview**
This project is a simple Android application developed in Java that demonstrates a basic login form. The app provides a user interface for users to enter their credentials (username/email and password) and authenticate themselves before accessing the main features of the app[3][4].

**Features**
- User-friendly login screen with input fields for username/email and password.
- Basic input validation to ensure required fields are filled.
- Simple authentication logic (can be extended to connect with a backend or use local validation).
- Error messages for invalid or empty inputs.
- Clean and modern UI with smooth transitions.
- Easily customizable for integration with registration, password reset, or backend authentication.

**How It Works**
- The user is presented with a login screen upon launching the app.
- After entering credentials and tapping the login button, the app validates the input.
- If the input is valid, the app proceeds to the next activity (e.g., home screen).
- If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed.

**Tech Stack**
- Language: Java
- Platform: Android Studio (compatible with Android 4.0+)
- UI: XML layouts

**Getting Started**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or Android device.

**Customization**
- You can extend the login logic to connect with a backend server or Firebase for real authentication.
- UI elements can be customized in the XML layout files to match your appâ€™s branding.
